#CATARRGH!

You are a robo cat and you've just broken out from the Feline Uber Research Bunker Augmenting Large Lunch Yearnings, or F.U.R.B.A.L.L.Y.

The lab wants to stop you at all costs and sends out one of its bots to throw irrestistable foods into your path as you run down a disused tunnel.

Each time robo cat eats a piece of food he'll grow fatter and slower, eventually getting too big for the tunnel and impaled on the inconveniently place spikes.

Luckily, eating food also charges up cat's Food Boost. Once it reaches 100% you can tap on cat to induce a high-speed spurt of speed, burning off those extra calories and returning cat to normal size. Alternatively, tap on the bot to fire a fiery projectile.

How far can you get before meeting a slow and blobby death?
